Ambapo
======
Ambapo, named after the Swahili word for "where", allows for the conversion of latitude and longitude, using any geodetic datum, to Universal Transverse Mercator and vice versa. One conversion can be done or a bulk conversion of a CSV file. If converting from UTM to lat/long, the data should be put in the CSV file as follows:

  easting, northing, hemisphere, zone number, zone letter

None of the numbers should contain commas, as that is how the values are separated. The hemisphere should be denoted as N or S. You do not need both a hemisphere AND a zone letter, but you do need one or the other. If either of this information is missing, put an asterisk (*) in its place.
